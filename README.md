![Nürburgring Drive](docs/hero.png)

A first-person driving simulator running on **real OpenStreetMap track geometry** —
Three.js rendering over a hand-written **240 Hz vehicle physics engine**. One
codebase, shipped to web and Android (Capacitor).

**System Overview — [drive-game.pages.dev/data/game_logic.html](https://drive-game.pages.dev/data/game_logic.html)**

**Build log — [drive-game.pages.dev/making](https://drive-game.pages.dev/making)** — the full session it was built in (Korean, with an English toggle).

## Features

- **Real tracks** — Nürburgring (20.7 km, OSM geometry + DEM elevation),
  Spa-Francorchamps, and a practice circuit.
- **Custom physics (240 Hz)** — raycast suspension, Pacejka combined-slip tires,
  clutch launch model, aerodynamics, per-surface and weather grip.
- **Weather & time** — noon, Eifel morning fog, sunset, night, rain (wet road +
  reduced grip), and night with street lighting.
- **Feel** — AudioWorklet waveguide engine sound, instrument cluster with shift
  lights, ghost laps, and a dynamic racing line.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:8741
npm run build    # → dist/
```

Android (Capacitor): `npm run build && npx cap sync android`, then Gradle `assembleDebug`.
